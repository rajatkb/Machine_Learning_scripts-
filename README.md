# Machine_Learning_scripts-
Machine_learning_Scripts will be a collection of all small time analytics that i do with datasets. The repo includes simple mathematical methods implementations or sklearn based one analysis. 
# 1. Gradient Descent
  In order to use the script just simply call the script while passing simple parameters as follow  
  
  $ gradent_descent.py nameOfdatasetFile.csv feauture1 feature2 learningrate_or_alpha epoc  
  
  all of the parameters are mandatory.Proper learning rate should chosen. i.e below 1 obviously you dont want your function  
  to overshoot.
# 2. K-Nearest Neighbour
  Ya its knn nothing really interesting... why is it even here !! Ahh i know for people looking out for simple implementation example too   look into
